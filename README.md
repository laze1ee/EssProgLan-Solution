# Solving the exercises of Essentials of Programming Languages

I used the editor Texmacs to arrange all exercises in this book. Since not many people use the Texmacs, I exported a PDF file (EssProgLan-solution.pdf) as an entry for looking up. You can easily find every section's source codes in corrensponding folder. I would greatly appreciate if could report any issue with the solution to me.
